## What is DX

Developer experience refers to the experience developers have in an environment where software development occurs and the level of complexity that allows them to turn ideas into usable and useful applications. It incorporates the feelings that a developer derives from working within an organization.

### Core Components of DX
1. Tools and infrastructure
2. Following best practices & coding standards
3. Documentation and resources
4. Streamlined code review.
5. Team and system processes
6. Clear ownership structure and support.

### Linting
Linting is important to reduce errors and improve the overall quality of your code. The process of linting, aided by lint tools, can keep source code consistent and improve code review.

### NOTE
We will discuss details about improving DX in following:

1. Coding Standards
2. Linting and Static Analysis Tools
3. Including Linting Tools in Your Project
4. Setting Up Linting in IDEs

## **1. Coding Standards**

This project follows the following coding standards:

- **PSR-12:** The official PHP coding standard, providing a base set of rules for code formatting. [PSR-12 Documentation](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
- **Laravel Coding Style:** Extends PSR-12 with conventions specific to Laravel development. [Laravel Contributing Guide](https://laravel.com/docs/contributions) (See Code Style section)

**Key Aspects:**

- **Indentation:** 4 spaces (no tabs).
- **Line length:** Maximum 120 characters.
- **Class and method naming:** Descriptive and consistent.
- **Docblocks:** Used for documenting classes, methods, and properties.
- **Array Syntax:** Always use short array syntax (`[]`).
- **Order of Methods:** Group methods logically (e.g., public before protected/private).

---

## **2. Linting and Static Analysis Tools**

The following tools are used to automate code quality checks:

### **PHPStan**
A static analysis tool that detects errors without executing the code. It helps identify type errors, undefined variables, and other potential issues.

- Install via Composer:
  ```bash
  composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
  ```
- Run analysis:
  ```bash
  vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
  ```

### **Laravel Pint**
An opinionated PHP code style fixer for minimalists. It automatically fixes code style issues based on PSR-12 and Laravel conventions.

- Install via Composer:
  ```bash
  composer require --dev laravel/pint
  ```
- Run Pint:
  ```bash
  ./vendor/bin/pint
  ```

### **PHP-CS-Fixer**
A more configurable code style fixer that can be used if more customization is needed beyond Pint's defaults.

- Install globally:
  ```bash
  composer global require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
  ```
- Basic usage:
  ```bash
  php-cs-fixer fix .
  ```

## **3. Including Linting Tools in Your Project**

### **Adding Tools to Composer Scripts**
Include linting commands in the `scripts` section of your `composer.json` file for easy access:

```json
"scripts": {
    "lint": [
        "phpstan analyse",
        "./vendor/bin/pint"
    ],
    "lint:fix": "./vendor/bin/pint"
}
```

Run these scripts using:

```bash
composer lint
composer lint:fix
```

### **Configuration Files**

1. **PHPStan Configuration**: Create a `phpstan.neon` file:
   ```neon
   includes:
       - vendor/phpstan/phpstan/conf/bleedingEdge.neon

   parameters:
       level: max
       paths:
           - app
           - routes
       excludePaths:
           - storage/framework/cache/*
   ```

2. **Laravel Pint Configuration**: Create a `pint.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "preset": "laravel",
       "rules": {
           "binary_operator_spaces": {
               "default": "align_single_space"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Git Pre-Commit Hook**: Automate linting before commits using Husky.
    - Install Husky:
      ```bash
      composer require --dev husky/husky
      ```
    - Add a pre-commit hook in `.husky/pre-commit`:
      ```bash
      #!/bin/sh
      composer lint
      ```

## **4. Setting Up Linting in IDEs**

### **VS Code**

1. Install Extensions:
    - **PHP Intelephense**
    - **Laravel Snippets**
    - **PHP CS Fixer**

2. Configure Settings:
   Open settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,`) and add:
   ```json
   "editor.formatOnSave": true,
   "phpcsfixer.executablePath": "~/.composer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer",
   "phpcsfixer.rules": {
       "@PSR12": true
   }
   ```

3. Add a `tasks.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "version": "2.0.0",
       "tasks": [
           {
               "label": "Lint PHP",
               "type": "shell",
               "command": "composer lint",
               "group": {
                   "kind": "build",
                   "isDefault": true
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

### **WebStorm**

1. Enable PHP Support:
    - Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
    - Install the PHP plugin.

2. Set Up PHP Interpreter:
    - Go to `File > Settings > PHP`.
    - Add a local PHP interpreter.

3. Integrate PHP-CS-Fixer:
    - Go to `File > Settings > Tools > External Tools`.
    - Add a new tool with these settings:
        - **Name**: PHP-CS-Fixer
        - **Program**: Path to `php-cs-fixer`
        - **Arguments**: `fix $FilePath$`
        - **Working Directory**: `$ProjectFileDir$`

4. Set Up File Watchers:
    - Go to `File > Settings > File Watchers`.
    - Add a watcher for PHP-CS-Fixer.
